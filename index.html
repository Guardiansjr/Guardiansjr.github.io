It is a six sided toy that normally includes the colors: White, Blue, Red, Green, Orange, and Yellow. The Rubik's Cube can come in many different sizes. The most common known size is the 3x3. But these sizes go all the way from 1x1 to 13x13!</td>
    <td width="1000px">Researchers found that the Rubik's Cube can be solved in 20 moves or less, regardless of the scramble. This is called God's Number. But normally, people solve the cube in about 50-70 moves. It might seam a lot, but when you are turning it with a tps (turns per second) of 8, that is quite fast.</td>

									<p>The Rubik's Cube was first invented in the 1980's by Erno Rubik, a math teacher who enjoyed giving his students fun and challenging puzzles. At that time, Erno Rubik named it the 'Magic Cube'. It took him about a month to finally be able to solve it. After seeing the potential of the "Magic Cube", he agreed to let Toy Corp mass produce it.</p>

							<h2>Cubers</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Solving a Rubik's Cube may be challenging enough, but solving a it within ten seconds, is a whole new thing. People who solve the Rubik's Cube fast, are called cubers. Cubers practice for hours and hours to improve the time it takes to solve it. Cubers go to competitions to compete and try to set a competition PB (Personal Best). There are more than 40,000 cubers world wide that have competed in a cube competition. But there is probably at least 100,000 cubers worldwide.</p>

							<h2>The Fastest Cubers</h2>
						
						</header>
						<div id= "Feliks"> <p> If you asked anyone cuber in the world who the fastest cuber is, they would probably say Feliks Zemdegs. Although Feliks Zemdegs doesnt hold the world record for the fastest 3x3 time, he does hold the world record for the 3x3 average. Meaning in 5 solves, the average of the 5 solves is faster than anyone else in the world. The average was 6.54 seconds. He solves the cube in a different way you would find on the internet if you search up how to solve a Rubik's Cube. The method that he uses is called CFOP. Most fast cubers in the world use this method too. The current world record holder for the fastest 3x3 time is held by Collin Burns with a time of 5.25 seconds. But Feliks Zemdegs has come close to this time with a time of 5.39 seconds. </p>

							<h2>Competitions</h2>
						
						</header>
						<p>Cubers go to competitions to compete, make new friends, meet fast cubers, and of course, having fun. A competition is also a place where world records are made. Even if you get a three second solve at home, it wouldn't count as a world record because it wasn't done at a competition, therefore it could have been setup or fake. But at a competition, the solves are all real. To make sure that the competition is fair and not fake, the staff would give all the cubers the same scramble. There is also a judge sitting next to the cuber for the whole solve, to make sure that the competitor is not cheating. Every year, there is a big competition called "US Nationals". "US Nationals" normally has about 500-550competitors. Every two years, there is an even bigger competition called "World Championships".</p>

							<h2>The Rubik's Cube, Today</h2>
						
						</header>
						<p> At first, the Rubik's Cube was just a small handmade toy that Erno Rubik had created. Now, its one of the worlds most sold toy ever with an outstanding 350,000,000 sales. The cubing community is really a great community to be part of. Everyone is so nice and friendly. I highly recommend you to join it. Just pick up a cube, and solve it!</p>
